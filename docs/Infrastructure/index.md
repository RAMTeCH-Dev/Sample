## Overview

Automation of ArcGIS configuration management operations such as initial deployments, upgrades, and disaster recovery improves operational excellence, security, and reliability of ArcGIS deployments. Leveraging IT automation tools provides a platform for automation of ArcGIS operations that follows the industry’s best practices.

[Chef Infra](https://docs.chef.io/chef_overview/) 
is a powerful automation platform that transforms infrastructure into code. 
Whether you’re operating in the cloud, on-premises, or in a hybrid environment, 
Chef Infra automates how infrastructure is configured, deployed, and managed.

[Chef cookbook](https://docs.chef.io/cookbooks/) 
is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution in Chef Infra that defines a scenario and 
contains everything that is required to support that scenario: recipes, attribute values, custom resources, files, 
and templates. Recipes specify which Chef Infra built-in resources to use, as well as the order in which they are to be 
applied. Attribute values allow environment-based configurations such as dev or production.

Chef Cookbooks for ArcGIS is a collection of Chef [cookbooks](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-cookbook/cookbooks.html) 
for configuration, deployment, and management of ArcGIS Enterprise, ArcGIS Pro, and ArcGIS Desktop.

[ArcGIS deployment templates](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-cookbook/templates.html) 
provide ready-to-use Chef JSON files for deploying ArcGIS with Chef. The JSON files are specific to ArcGIS versions, 
platforms, and machine roles. The deployment templates provide a straightforward and deterministic way to 
automate initial deployments and upgrades of ArcGIS Enterprise on-premises and in the cloud.
